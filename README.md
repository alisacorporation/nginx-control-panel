# nginx-control-panel
![app demo screenshot](https://github.com/iBrabus/nginx-control-panel/blob/master/demo.png)

nginx start stop restart from gui (maded to improve skills)

Status is only showing / refreshing (with delay 2 seconds) after each button is clicked, in future can be added status updater in cycle..
This is my second app GUI on java (first on JavaFX) - created to improve skills little bit and show that developing GUI on java is easy and fun..

# Run software
$ git clone https://github.com/iBrabus/nginx-control-panel
$ cd nginx-control-panel
$ java -jar out/artifacts/java_gui_intro_jar/java-gui-intro.jar

`thats all, ty <3`

I would love to get feedback. Thanks!
